# Real Power Tech – Final Go‑Live Checklist (Step‑by‑Step)

Purpose: A guided, test‑driven runbook to complete the remaining work and launch the MVP. Each step has clear actions and tests. Check items off as you complete them.

Legend:

- [ ] To do
- [x] Done

Prerequisites

- [ ] Production/staging Vercel project is created and the app deploys successfully
- [ ] MongoDB Atlas database is provisioned and accessible from Vercel and the RADIUS host
- [ ] ClickPesa credentials available (Client ID, API Key, Checksum Key), Hosted Checkout enabled
- [ ] A MikroTik hAP ax² router on-site with Hotspot enabled (per deviceSetuReport.md)
- [ ] A Linux VM for FreeRADIUS with a static public IP (e.g., Fly.io/DigitalOcean)

Environment variables (Vercel)

- [ ] MONGODB_URI, MONGODB_DB
- [ ] CLICKPESA_BASE_URL (default ok), CLICKPESA_CLIENT_ID, CLICKPESA_API_KEY, CLICKPESA_CHECKSUM_KEY
- [ ] CLICKPESA_CURRENCY (e.g., TZS)
- [ ] RADIUS_WRITE_ENABLED="true" (only enable after RADIUS setup is live)

Step 1 — Add the Success page and return flow (App)
Actions

- [x] Create `app/success/page.js` that:
  - Reads `orderReference` from the URL
  - Calls `GET /api/v1/portal/transactions/{orderReference}`
  - Shows status and package details; if `Pending`, auto‑poll every 2–3s until `Completed` or `Failed`
  - Shows “You are connected!” when completed
- [x] In ClickPesa dashboard, set the hosted checkout Return URL to your domain: `https://<your-domain>/success?orderReference={{orderReference}}` (if placeholder unsupported, set `/success`)

Test

- [ ] Load `/success?orderReference=TEST123` manually; confirm page renders and polling calls the API cleanly

Step 2 — Webhook configuration (ClickPesa → App)
Actions

- [x] In ClickPesa dashboard, set Webhook URL to `https://<your-domain>/api/v1/webhooks/clickpesa` for both PAYMENT RECEIVED and PAYMENT FAILED
- [ ] Ensure `CLICKPESA_CHECKSUM_KEY` matches the key configured in ClickPesa

Test

- [ ] Use a small paid or sandbox transaction to confirm your app returns 200 and the Transaction status becomes `Completed`

Step 3 — RADIUS data model alignment
Recommendation (standard approach)

- Keep reply attributes (e.g., `Session-Timeout`) in `radreply`, and acceptance in `radcheck`.

Actions

- [ ] Choose one of:
  - Option A (recommended): Update the app to write `Session-Timeout` into a `radreply` collection and create a `radcheck` record for acceptance (e.g., `Auth-Type := Accept`) tied to the same username (normalized client MAC)
  - Option B (fallback): Configure FreeRADIUS to read reply attributes from your existing `radcheck` collection (non‑standard, not recommended long‑term)
- [ ] Add indexes on `username` and a TTL index on `expiresAt` for cleanup

Test

- [ ] Insert a test `username` (MAC) with a short `Session-Timeout=60` and confirm RADIUS replies it back on Access‑Accept (see Step 6 for an end‑to‑end test)

Step 4 — FreeRADIUS deployment and config
Actions

- [ ] Install FreeRADIUS and `rlm_mongodb`
- [ ] Configure MongoDB connection for `radcheck` and `radreply`
- [ ] Configure `clients.conf` to accept your MikroTik router(s) with a strong shared secret
- [ ] In sites‑enabled (authorize/authenticate), accept users present in MongoDB and reply with `Session-Timeout` (and optional `Mikrotik-Rate-Limit`)
- [ ] Enable accounting (1813) if you want session logs (optional)

Test

- [ ] From the MikroTik, run a test authentication using the client MAC as the username; confirm Access‑Accept and presence of `Session-Timeout`

Step 5 — MikroTik Hotspot and walled garden (pre‑auth allowlist)
Required pre‑auth domains

- Your portal domain (Vercel): `portal.<your-domain>` or your chosen hostname
- ClickPesa hosted checkout: `checkout.clickpesa.com`

Actions

- [ ] Enable RADIUS: `/ip hotspot profile set [your-profile] use-radius=yes`
- [ ] Enable MAC auth (passwordless experience): `/ip hotspot profile set [your-profile] login-by=mac,http-chap` and `/ip hotspot set [hotspot] addresses-per-mac=2`
- [ ] Walled garden allowlist:
  - [ ] Add your portal domain (and optional wildcard for assets if needed)
  - [ ] Add `checkout.clickpesa.com`
  - Note: If any payment assets load from other ClickPesa subdomains/CDNs, add them too after testing
- [ ] Customize `login.html` to immediately redirect to your portal:
  - `https://portal.<your-domain>/portal?mac=$(mac)&locationId=<ObjectId>`
  - Use the specific location’s MongoDB `_id` for `locationId` so the app links revenue to the right partner

Test

- [ ] Connect to the hotspot as a new client
- [ ] Confirm the browser is captured and redirected to your portal
- [ ] Confirm you can open `checkout.clickpesa.com` before payment (but general internet is still blocked)

Step 6 — End‑to‑end payment → access grant
Actions

- [ ] On the portal, select a package and trigger Hosted Checkout
- [ ] Complete a real/sandbox payment on ClickPesa
- [ ] Let the ClickPesa webhook hit your app; app updates Transaction to `Completed` and writes RADIUS records

Test

- [ ] After payment success, you land on `/success?orderReference=...`; status turns `Completed`
- [ ] The device gains internet access automatically (no password)
- [ ] Verify FreeRADIUS shows an Access‑Accept with `Session-Timeout` and MikroTik status shows the user logged in
- [ ] After the purchased time elapses, access is revoked automatically

Step 7 — Reporting and reconciliation
Actions

- [ ] Use Admin → Reports to generate a report for a partner and a date range
- [ ] Verify totals match ClickPesa statements for that period

Test

- [ ] Totals reconcile; operator/partner shares calculate correctly per configured %

Step 8 — Monitoring and alerts
Actions

- [ ] Add Sentry (frontend + API routes)
- [ ] Set uptime monitors: portal URL and RADIUS UDP 1812/1813
- [ ] Configure log shipping or alerts on webhook failures

Test

- [ ] Force a test error and confirm Sentry captures it
- [ ] Stop RADIUS briefly and confirm uptime alert fires (staging)

Step 9 — Go‑live checks

- [ ] DNS: `portal.<your-domain>` → Vercel; `radius.<your-domain>` → RADIUS VM IP
- [ ] Secrets rotated and stored only in Vercel/VM envs
- [ ] RADIUS client list contains all production routers
- [ ] Walled garden entries present on all routers
- [ ] Rollback plan prepared (disable use‑radius / remove redirect if needed)

Appendix — Notes and tips

- If you see HTTPS CNA issues on some devices, ensure the immediate redirect points to your HTTPS portal domain and the router serves only its internal login page briefly before redirecting.
- If the hosted checkout loads assets from additional subdomains (fonts, images, scripts), add them to the walled garden after observing network requests in the browser devtools.
- To improve UX, display the location name on the portal when `locationId` is present (optional polish).
